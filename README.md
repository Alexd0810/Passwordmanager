## Description

### Why did I build this?
I built a password manager in Python, which took me 6 hours to complete.

### Why?
After being hacked on multiple accounts over the course of 2 years, and trying various methods to prevent it, such as 2FA, I thought it might be due to my password manager, as it was free.

## First Step

1. You need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) to your device.
2. Test that you have installed Pyhton:

If there wasn't an output then restart your device and if there is now an output we can go to the next Step!
